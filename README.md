# ng2-meet-and-git

Simple app to illustrate how to build a somewhat non-trivial Angular app. It allows users search for the most highly ranked "code ninjas" in any given location and any language of your choice!

## Installation

Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/andela-kakpobome/ng2-meet-and-git.git
```

Navigate to the root folder in your `cli` and run:

```
npm install
```

This will install all the dependencies required to run the app

Finally, run:

```
ng serve
```

This should `bundle` the app's dependencies and start a server listening on port `4200`. You can then navigate to your browser to explore the app!
